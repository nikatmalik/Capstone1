Discussion:
Cluster 0 is the central most part of the city.
Cluster 1 is the middle area of the city 
          between central core and outer boundaries.
Cluster 2 is the boundary areas of the city.

The highest number of venues are in the Food and Fish & Chip Shop categories. 
Data doesn’t take into account a venue’s size and unique characteristic 
features necessarily. The central part of city is oldest with plenty of history, 
so has most art and culture attractions, this is clearly visible from a 
comparison of the three different clusters which when viewed on a map show 
differing characteristics.


Conclusion:
The above data and analysis provides an insight into the city’s growth 
and development indicating areas for future extension in line with 
inhabitants’ preferences. This data should be combined with other 
insightful data like population and demographics to provide 
more accurate results.
